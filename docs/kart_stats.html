            <h2>How to Read the Graphs</h2>
            <p>
                This page provides an in-depth analysis of kart performances on various maps. Use the dropdown to 
                select a specific map and view the associated graphs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Race Time Graph:</strong> Displays the distribution of race times for each kart on the selected map. 
                    Lower times indicate better performance. Karts are sorted based on their median race times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Win Rate Heatmap:</strong> Shows pairwise comparisons of kart performance. The values represent 
                    the <em>win rate</em> of one kart against another as a percentage (0-100). A value of 100 means a kart 
                    consistently outperformed another in head-to-head races, while a value of 0 means a kart never placed higher than the other in a recorded race. 
                    Empty cells indicate that the karts have never raced against each other. To read the heatmap, focus <strong>row by row</strong>: each row 
                    corresponds to a specific kart (<em>Kart A</em>), and the values in that row display its win rates 
                    against all other karts (<em>Kart B</em>) listed in the columns. Diagonal values are empty because 
                    a kart's performance against itself is not counted.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The win rate heatmap provides a quick way to identify the most dominant karts on each map and 
                understand how they stack up against competitors.
